The verification web tool offers users the ability to evaluate the skill of various forecasts in many different ways by allowing users to subset forecasts to verify. Forecasts are verified by comparing previously made forecasts with the observed values (what actually happened). This provides valuable information to the user about how the forecasts performed, which can help the user determine what forecasts and situations typically provide better skill and apply that knowledge when using real-time forecasts.

<b>Using the verification web tool (VWT) </b>
Below is an overview of the sections of the tool. You can select the “About” tab for more detailed information about the web tool or click on question marks next to the options for more information. 

<b>Selecting options</b>
You can select either the “chart” or “map” tabs at the top of the tool, which displays verification results as either a chart, or map, respectively. When the “chart”  tab is selected, you can select the type of spatial boundaries to select geographical regions to verify forecasts for.  When the “map” tab is selected, you can select the type of time options you want to verify over (date range, months/seasons/years, and climate phenomena). Then you can select other options in the “Select Options” box. When you have finished selecting options, hit the “update” button. 

*It is important to note that many form options change other options. You should see pop-up boxes of warnings that will notify you of unavailable option combinations. Therefore, you may need to select different options depending on your current selections.
