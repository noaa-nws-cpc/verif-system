<h4>Interpreting the X-Axis</h4>
<p>The values on the x-axis are the <i>forecast</i> probabilities.</p>
<h4>Interpreting the Y-Axis</h4>
<p>The values on the x-axis are the <i>observed</i> probabilities.</p>
<h4>About the reference line</h4>
<p>The reference line represents "perfect forecasts". Values on this line indicate that the forecast probability for a given category matches the percentage of time that category occurred. For example, the point on the line where the x-axis and y-axis values are 0.2 and 0.2, respectively, indicates that forecasts with a probability of 20% were observed 20% of the time. See the "Understanding the skill score" section below for interpreting results based on this line.</p>
<h4>Interpreting the Probability Intervals</h4>
<p>Forecasts are placed into bins defined by probability thresholds. The range of probabilities for the bins include the lower bin threshold and are less than the upper bin threshold, except for the first and last bins. The first bin includes all forecasts with probabilities greater than or equal to 0 and less than 0.1. The last bin includes all forecasts with probabilities greater than or equal to 0.9 and less than or equal to 1. The lowest probability for a manual forecast category of above or below normal drawn on the map is .3334.</p>
<p>Equal chance (EC) forecasts for monthly and seasonal forecasts <i>are</i> included in the scores. There is a separate bin at .3333 for EC forecasts (forecast probabilities of exactly 1/3). This bin represents the observed frequency of a given category when the forecast for that category (either below, near, or above normal) is exactly equal to the long term climatological value. Many of these cases are from EC forecasts, where all three categories are forecast to have climatological chances of occurrence. EC forecasts are scored as forecasts for each category. The N category for this bin contains reliability scores for EC forecasts and forecasts where N is .3333. The A and B categories for this bin contain EC forecasts and also may contain forecasts of .3333 for their respective categories, although forecasts of .3333 for A or B only occur in rare cases when there is a forecast of .3334 for N. A sum of the reliability of the EC and N forecasts is used to calculate the reliability for the N/EC category for the .3333 probability bin. In short, the reliability for the .3333 bin can be attributed all or mostly to EC forecasts for the A and B categories and approximately even amounts of N and EC forecasts for the N category. The reliability of all categories together for this bin is the sum of the B, N/EC, and A reliabilities.</p>
<h4>Understanding the skill score</h4>
<p>The reliability diagram indicates how often the forecast probabilities match the percentage of time that the categories actually occurred. The closer the plotted values to the reference line, the more reliable the forecast. If the reliability is plotted above the reference line, the forecasts were overconfident (probabilities were too high). If the reliability is plotted below the reference line, the forecasts were underconfident (probabilities were too low).</p>
<p>Reliability scores for each category for each bin are always assessed separately to calculate the scores, and the reliability is calculated for each category and bin regardless of which category was forecast. For each category and for each probability bin, the following equation is calculated:</p>
<code>reliability<sub>category</sub> = # obs<sub>category</sub> / # fcst<sub>category</sub></code>
<p>Reliability for each bin for all forecast categories together is obatained by summing the reliability scores for each category to get the total score:</p>
<code>reliability = (# obs A / # fcst A) + (# obs B / # fcst B) + (# obs N / # fcst N)</code>
<p>where the # obs of a category for a probability bin are obtained by counting the number of occurrences where the forecast within that probability bin correctly had that category. The # fcst of a category for a probability bin are obtained by counting the number of occurrences where there is a forecast for that category with a probability that falls within the probability bin.</p>
