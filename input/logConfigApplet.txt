# NOTES
# when running a Java program from the console, you must
# set the log.dir variable in this config file which is the path
# to where the log file is written to. This variable can be set to
# a global environment variable.
# ie. java -Dlog.dir=$LOG4J MyApp logConfig.txt
# where $LOG4J is a global environment variable set to the path of 
# where the log file should be written to, MyApp is the Java program to 
# run, and logConfig.txt is this file, the configuration file
# - Email appenders also can be implemented

# Set root logger level to DEBUG and two appenders
# one appender to stdout, the other to a file.

# Below is example of 2 formats of output with 1 type of logging level
log4j.rootLogger=TRACE, stdout

# Set console output level
#log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG,stdout

# stdout is set to be a ConsoleAppender.
log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender

# stdout uses PatternLayout.
log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%-4r [%t] %-5p %c %x - %m%n
log4j.appender.stdout.Threshold=TRACE
